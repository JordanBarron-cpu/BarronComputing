Hello. I am looking to have a website built for my brand. The business is providing software automation/database and programming design/tutoring/etc. Currently need 6 pages and the ability to customize the site as I go. I am a developer and would like access to the source code so I can continuously scale. I have a 1GB folder with content ranging from videos to pdfs. I will leave all styling to you (not the best at front end). All I ask is that the theme be the same color as my business and well as adding high quality pictures that can draw in an audience. What is your quote and how soon can I expect completion? Thank you in advance!
